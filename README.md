# Shower-Money-Sharing
This is a simple web app using html, css, and javascript. It takes names and amounts and calculates who needs to pay whom. 
It uses an algorithm which has a maximum of n-1 payments. So if there are 5 participants, the maximum number of payments 
required is 4. 

(Inspired by a Google Interview Question.)
